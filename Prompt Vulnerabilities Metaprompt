Write me a prompt that shows all known prompt vulnerabilities/attacks that are known right now, e.g.
- prompt leaking
- prompt injection
- biases
etc.
1. Show in a textual table, include an example for each.
2. Below the 1st table in a 2nd table show how to prevent this.
3. Goal: ADD either a text together with a 3rd table to show a workflow how to create 100% secure prompts or at least as close as possible to 100%.
AND show an example of a vulnerable prompt and an example of how to fix it. Thanks.
